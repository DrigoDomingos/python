## Project: Building a Student Intervention System

Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

### Question 1 - Classification vs. Regression
*Your goal for this project is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate. Which type of supervised learning problem is this, classification or regression? Why?*

    **Answer: ** It's clearly a binary **Classification** problem because it's expecting to predict between two possible labels eliminating the chance to be a regression problem.

## Exploring the Data
Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the student data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'passed'`, will be our target label (whether the student graduated or didn't graduate). All other columns are features about each student.

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from time import time
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Read student data
student_data = pd.read_csv("student-data.csv")
print "Student data read successfully!"

### Implementation: Data Exploration
Let's begin by investigating the dataset to determine how many students we have information on, and learn about the graduation rate among these students. In the code cell below, you will need to compute the following:
- The total number of students, `n_students`.
- The total number of features for each student, `n_features`.
- The number of those students who passed, `n_passed`.
- The number of those students who failed, `n_failed`.
- The graduation rate of the class, `grad_rate`, in percent (%).


# TODO: Calculate number of students
n_students = student_data.shape[0]

# TODO: Calculate number of features
n_features = student_data.shape[1]-1

# TODO: Calculate passing students
n_passed = (student_data.loc[student_data['passed'] == 'yes']).shape[0]

# TODO: Calculate failing students
n_failed = (student_data.loc[student_data['passed'] == 'no']).shape[0]

# TODO: Calculate graduation rate
grad_rate = (float(n_passed) / float(n_students))* 100

# Print the results
print "Total number of students: {}".format(n_students)
print "Number of features: {}".format(n_features)
print "Number of students who passed: {}".format(n_passed)
print "Number of students who failed: {}".format(n_failed)
print "Graduation rate of the class: {:.2f}%".format(grad_rate)

## Preparing the Data
In this section, we will prepare the data for modeling, training and testing.

### Identify feature and target columns
It is often the case that the data you obtain contains non-numeric features. This can be a problem, as most machine learning algorithms expect numeric data to perform computations with.

Run the code cell below to separate the student data into feature and target columns to see if any features are non-numeric.

# Extract feature columns
feature_cols = list(student_data.columns[:-1])

# Extract target column 'passed'
target_col = student_data.columns[-1] 

# Show the list of columns
print "Feature columns:\n{}".format(feature_cols)
print "\nTarget column: {}".format(target_col)

# Separate the data into feature data and target data (X_all and y_all, respectively)
X_all = student_data[feature_cols]
y_all = student_data[target_col]

# Show the feature information by printing the first five rows
print "\nFeature values:"
print X_all.head()

### Preprocess Feature Columns

As you can see, there are several non-numeric columns that need to be converted! Many of them are simply `yes`/`no`, e.g. `internet`. These can be reasonably converted into `1`/`0` (binary) values.

Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.

These generated columns are sometimes called _dummy variables_, and we will use the [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) function to perform this transformation. Run the code cell below to perform the preprocessing routine discussed in this section.

def preprocess_features(X):
    ''' Preprocesses the student data and converts non-numeric binary variables into
        binary (0/1) variables. Converts categorical variables into dummy variables. '''
    
    # Initialize new output DataFrame
    output = pd.DataFrame(index = X.index)

    # Investigate each feature column for the data
    for col, col_data in X.iteritems():
        
        # If data type is non-numeric, replace all yes/no values with 1/0
        if col_data.dtype == object:
            col_data = col_data.replace(['yes', 'no'], [1, 0])

        # If data type is categorical, convert to dummy variables
        if col_data.dtype == object:
            # Example: 'school' => 'school_GP' and 'school_MS'
            col_data = pd.get_dummies(col_data, prefix = col)  
        
        # Collect the revised columns
        output = output.join(col_data)
    
    return output

X_all = preprocess_features(X_all)
print "Processed feature columns ({} total features):\n{}".format(len(X_all.columns), list(X_all.columns))

### Implementation: Training and Testing Data Split
So far, we have converted all _categorical_ features into numeric values. For the next step, we split the data (both features and corresponding labels) into training and test sets. In the following code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Randomly shuffle and split the data (`X_all`, `y_all`) into training and testing subsets.
  - Use 300 training points (approximately 75%) and 95 testing points (approximately 25%).
  - Set a `random_state` for the function(s) you use, if provided.
  - Store the results in `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.

# TODO: Import any additional functionality you may need here
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# TODO: Set the number of training points
num_train = 300

# Set the number of testing points
num_test = X_all.shape[0] - num_train

# TODO: Shuffle and split the dataset into the number of training and testing points above

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_all, y_all, test_size=num_test, random_state=42)

#X_train = None
#X_test = None
#y_train = None
#y_test = None

# Show the results of the split
print "Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0])
print "Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0])

## Training and Evaluating Models
In this section, you will choose 3 supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem and available in `scikit-learn`. You will first discuss the reasoning behind choosing these three models by considering what you know about the data and each model's strengths and weaknesses. You will then fit the model to varying sizes of training data (100 data points, 200 data points, and 300 data points) and measure the F<sub>1</sub> score. You will need to produce three tables (one for each model) that shows the training set size, training time, prediction time, F<sub>1</sub> score on the training set, and F<sub>1</sub> score on the testing set.

**The following supervised learning models are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that you may choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
*List three supervised learning models that are appropriate for this problem. For each model chosen*
- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. *(You may need to do a small bit of research for this â€” give references!)* 
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well? 
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?

**Answer: **

**1- Decision Trees:**

1.1 - Based on my research I figured out lot of application related to recomendation systems, That sounds to be  the most comun application for Decision tree. I'd like to cite a facebook application to sugest groups for user to join, that is interesting because there's bilions of user and tons of groups out there, and without an Artificial Intelligence system like that discover and sugest groups that is interesting for user would be impossible.
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-88875-8_41?LI=true


1.2 - The Decision tree performs well when:
Need to explain for business the features behaviors behind the model.
Don't need or want spend too much time on Feature engineering.
Need so support on feature selection - DT performs implicity selection.
It performs well with huge amount of data and take more time to train and less to predict.

1.3 - The disavantages of use the decision tree are:
The model can overfit easily while create a very complex trees.
Decision tree can be instable due to small variance in the data can modify drastically the trees.

1.4 That is binary classification problem, so decision tree models fits well because it's easy to understand the feature behavior and support me on the feature selection (implicit performed).
 
    
        
**2- Support Vector Machines (SVM)**


2.1 -  I'd like to cite a use case from BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making that used SVM in a research of comun diseases. The best results hit around 83.5% of accuracy classifying patients with or without diabetes.
https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16

2.2 - The SVM is a powerfull regretion and classification model, that is usually used for classifcation purpose, the biggest benefit of using this model is the flexibility of the parameter tunning, specially the kernel trick that give a great possibility for the model increase the accuracy.

2.3 - There's a limitation about the size and speed on both trainning and testing, it's recomended for small datasets, also applying the parameter tunning can create a very comple model, hard to interpret.

2.4 - Given a small dataset that was provided and the binary classification problem, SVM seems to be a good candidate to analyse the performance, The main reason of choose this model also is the possibiliy of parameter tunning to encrease the performance and also test a model linearly separabe.


**3- Ensemble Methods - Random Forest**

3.1 - I found out some use cases including a heavy usage on Kaggle competitions. One that I'd like to cite here is a project to predict the crime in San Francisco - CA. They used random forest  and hit around 72.4% of accuracy against the average 67.1% of a single decision tree.
https://algobeans.com/2016/08/25/random-forest-tutorial/


3.2 - The Random forest is widely used due to the easy implementation, ability to avoid overfit while the user increase the number of tree looking for more accuracy. Another positive point about Random Forest ensemble method is the ability to handle unbalancing dataset and finally can be used for large datasets.

3.3 - The training performance require a powerful hardware depending of the amount of parallel classifiers (Trees) you are training inside RF.

3.4 - I'm considering to use this model in this project due to the possibilite to compare the ensemble method against a single decision tree, and this model according to the course and my research works well for a binary classification problem.





### Setup
Run the code cell below to initialize three helper functions which you can use for training and testing the three supervised learning models you've chosen above. The functions are as follows:
- `train_classifier` - takes as input a classifier and training data and fits the classifier to the data.
- `predict_labels` - takes as input a fit classifier, features, and a target labeling and makes predictions using the F<sub>1</sub> score.
- `train_predict` - takes as input a classifier, and the training and testing data, and performs `train_clasifier` and `predict_labels`.
 - This function will report the F<sub>1</sub> score for both the training and testing data separately.

def train_classifier(clf, X_train, y_train):
    ''' Fits a classifier to the training data. '''
    
    # Start the clock, train the classifier, then stop the clock
    start = time()
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    end = time()
    
    # Print the results
    print "Trained model in {:.4f} seconds".format(end - start)

    
def predict_labels(clf, features, target):
    ''' Makes predictions using a fit classifier based on F1 score. '''
    
    # Start the clock, make predictions, then stop the clock
    start = time()
    y_pred = clf.predict(features)
    end = time()
    
    # Print and return results
    print "Made predictions in {:.4f} seconds.".format(end - start)
    return f1_score(target.values, y_pred, pos_label='yes')


def train_predict(clf, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test):
    ''' Train and predict using a classifer based on F1 score. '''
    
    # Indicate the classifier and the training set size
    print "Training a {} using a training set size of {}. . .".format(clf.__class__.__name__, len(X_train))
    
    # Train the classifier
    train_classifier(clf, X_train, y_train)
    
    # Print the results of prediction for both training and testing
    print "F1 score for training set: {:.4f}.".format(predict_labels(clf, X_train, y_train))
    print "F1 score for test set: {:.4f}.".format(predict_labels(clf, X_test, y_test))

### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics
With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below â€” 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.
 - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.
 - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model â€” you will tune one specific model in a later section.
- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.
 - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*
- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  
**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results.

# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn

## Choosing the Best Model
In this final section, you will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. You will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F<sub>1</sub> score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model
*Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?*

**Answer: ** SVM Classifier is the model that best fit this problem. In terms of Training and prediction time it's in middle position comparing to the other 2 models and in terms of test accuracy it hit around 0.7838, the best result comparing to DT and ENSEMBLE 0.7040 and 0.7536 respectively.

### Question 4 - Model in Layman's Terms
*In one to two paragraphs, explain to the board of directors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work. Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*

**Answer: ** Based on the historical information, the predictive model will identify the standard behavior behind  students that do not passed, based on this it will tag the currently students that are running into the same behaviors. 

The SVM model creates a decision boundary line considering all features available on the historical data trying to create a line that best separete the students that passed from the ones that not passed. The closest data points on both points(dark blue end dark red) represents the 'Support vectors' that is importante to support the contruction of the best line that should be as far as possible from the all data points.

![nome_imagem.png](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/_images/optimal-hyperplane.png)


In the case where the data is not linearly separable,  there is a capability called 'kernel trick' that consist in turn the data into linearly separable data as showed below:
![rotate.gif](http://blog.pluskid.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rotate.gif)

Support vectors 


### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.
- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.
 - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_obj`.

plt.title('Confusion Matrix for the Test Set')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')

### Question 5 - Final F<sub>1</sub> Score
*What is the final model's F<sub>1</sub> score for training and testing? How does that score compare to the untuned model?*




**Answer: ** Tuned model has a training F1 score of 0.8323.
Tuned model has a testing F1 score of **0.7945**.

The tuned model increase the accuracy of testing dataset in around 1.3%; Considering the total number of students it represents around 4 students that is a good achievement.I the other hand for the training dataset the accuracy decrease, meaning that the tuned models is more generalist.
